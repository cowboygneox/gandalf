# Gandalf Authentication Proxy

![Gandalf Meme: "You shall not pass!"](https://github.com/cowboygneox/gandalf/blob/master/assets/gandalf.jpg?raw=true)

## Explanation

The Gandalf Authentication Proxy manages authentication in your system so that the rest of your system doesn't have to. Motivated by microservice architecture and polyglot aspirations, applying a system-wide authentication filter removes complexity, duplication, and is ultimately more secure due to its simplicity.
